 * @param[in] particleEnd          end index of locally owned particles prior to exchange
 * @param[in] arraySize            size of @p arrays

 * @param[in] ordering             Ordering to access arrays, valid w.r.t to [particleStart:particleEnd], ON DEVICE.
 * @param[inout] arrays            Pointers of different types but identical sizes. The index range based exchange
 *                                 operations performed are identical for each input array. Upon completion, arrays will
 *                                 contain elements from the specified ranges and ranks.
 *                                 The order in which the incoming ranges are grouped is random. ON DEVICE.
 *
 *  Example: If sendList[ri] contains the range [upper, lower), all elements (arrays+inputOffset)[ordering[upper:lower]]
 *           will be sent to rank ri. At the destination ri, the incoming elements
 *           will be either prepended or appended to elements already present on ri.
 *           No information about incoming particles to @p thisRank is contained in the function arguments,
 *           only their total number @p nParticlesAssigned, which also includes any assigned particles
 *           already present on @p thisRank.
