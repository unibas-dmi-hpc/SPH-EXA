/*! @brief @file parallel binary radix tree construction implementation
 *
 * @author Sebastian Keller <sebastian.f.keller@gmail.com>
 *
 * Algorithm published in https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2383795.2383801
 * and further illustrated at
 * https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/thinking-parallel-part-iii-tree-construction-gpu/
 *
 * Most SFC-based functionality for SPH like domain decomposition, global octree build
 * and neighbor search does not need tree-traversal and explicit construction
 * of tree-internal nodes.
 *
 * The halo search problem is an exception. Finding all nodes in the global octree
 * that overlap with a given node that is enlarged by the search radius in all
 * dimensions is essentially the same as collision detection between objects
 * in 3D graphics, where bounding volume hierarchies are constructed from binary radix trees.
 *
 * The reason why the halo search problem differs from the other SFC-based algorithms
 * for neighbor search and domain decomposition is that an octree node that is enlarged
 * by an arbitrary distance in each dimension cannot necessarily be composed from octree
 * nodes of similar size as the query node and therefore also not as a range of SFC codes,
 * or the sum of a small number of SFC code ranges. This is especially true at the boundaries
 * between octree nodes of different division level, i.e. when large nodes are next to
 * very small nodes. For this reason, nodes enlarged by a halo radius are best represented
 * by x,y,z coordinate ranges.

 * 0 in the returned binary tree only maps binary nodes 0 <= ... < tree.size() -1.
 * Due to the last element of tree being the maximum Morton code 2^(30 or 61),
 * the last node/element of the returned binary tree will be set up as a useless
 * second root node that is not reachable from the root node with index 0.
 * So if @p tree is a cornerstone octree with an array size of N, we can say that
 *      - @p tree has N-1 octree leaf nodes
 *      - the output is a binary tree of array size N-1 with 0...N-2 as usable elements
 *
 * One could of course prevent the generation of the last binary node with index N-1,
 * but that would result in loss of generality for arbitrary sorted Morton code sequences
