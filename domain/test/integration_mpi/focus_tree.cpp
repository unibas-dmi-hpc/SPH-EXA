/*! @brief test for particle-count-exchange of distributed focused octrees
 *
 * First, all ranks create numRanks * numParticles random gaussian particle coordinates.
 * Since the random number generator is seeded with the same value on all ranks, all of them
 * will generate exactly the same numRanks * numParticles coordinates.
 *
 * This common coordinate set is then used to build a focus tree on each rank, using
 * non-communicating local algorithms to serve as the reference.
 * Each rank then takes the <thisRank>-th fraction of the common coordinate set and discards the other coordinates,
 * such that all ranks combined still have the original common set.
 * From the distributed coordinate set, the same focused trees are then built, but with distributed communicating
 * algorithms. This should yield the same tree on each rank as the local case,
