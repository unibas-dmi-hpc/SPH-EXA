==================
Welcome to SPH-EXA
==================
SPH-EXA is a C++20 simulation code for hydrodynamics simulations (with gravity
and other physics), parallelized with MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, and HIP.

SPH-EXA is built with high performance, scalability, portability, and
resilience in mind. Its SPH implementation is based on SPHYNX, ChaNGa, and
SPH-flow, three SPH codes selected in the PASC SPH-EXA project to act as parent
and reference codes to SPH-EXA.

The performance of standard codes is negatively impacted by factors such as
imbalanced multi-scale physics, individual time-stepping, halos exchange, and
long-range forces. Therefore, the goal is to extrapolate common basic SPH
features, and consolidate them in a fully optimized, Exascale-ready, MPI+X, SPH
code: SPH-EXA.
