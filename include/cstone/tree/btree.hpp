/*! \brief \file parallel binary radix tree construction implementation
 *
 * \author Sebastian Keller <sebastian.f.keller@gmail.com>
 *
 * Algorithm published in https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2383795.2383801
 * and further illustrated at
 * https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/thinking-parallel-part-iii-tree-construction-gpu/
 *
 * Most SFC-based functionality for SPH like domain decomposition, global octree build
 * and neighbor search does not need tree-traversal and explicit construction
 * of tree-internal nodes.
 *
 * The halo search problem is an exception. Finding all nodes in the global octree
 * that overlap with a given node that is enlarged by the search radius in all
 * dimensions is essentially the same as collision detection between objects
 * in 3D graphics, where bounding volume hierarchies are constructed from binary radix trees.
 *
 * The reason why the halo search problem differs from the other SFC-based algorithms
 * for neighbor search and domain decomposition is that an octree node that is enlarged
 * by an arbitrary distance in each dimension cannot necessarily be composed from octree
 * nodes of similar size as the query node and therefore also not as a range of Morton codes,
 * or the sum of a small number of Morton code ranges. This is especially true at the boundaries
 * between octree nodes of different division level, i.e. when large nodes are next to
 * very small nodes. For this reason, nodes enlarged by a halo radius are best represented
 * by separate x,y,z coordinate ranges.
 *
 * The best way to implement collision detection for the 3D box defined x,y,z coordinate ranges
 * is by constructing the internal tree part over the
 * global octree leaf nodes as a binary radix tree. Each internal node of the binary
 * radix tree can be constructed independently and thus the algorithm is ideally suited
 * for GPUs. Subsequent tree traversal to detect collisions can also be done for all leaf
 * nodes in parallel. It is possible to convert the internal binary tree into an octree,
 * as 3 levels in the binary tree correspond to one level in the equivalent octree.
 * Doing so could potentially speed up traversal by a bit, but it is not clear whether it
 * would make up for the overhead of constructing the internal octree.

/*! \brief create a binary radix tree from a cornerstone octree

 *                            or the locations of objects in 3D.
 *                            Cornerstone invariants are not a requirement for this function,
 *                            only that the codes be sorted and not contain any duplicates.
 * @param nNodes[in]          nNodes == length(tree) - 1
 *                            If \a tree is in cornerstone format, nNodes is the number of leaf nodes.
 * @param binaryTree[out]     output binary tree, length == \a nNodes
 * @return                    the internal part of the input tree constructed as binary nodes
 *
 * Note that if the input \a tree is a cornerstone octree, the root node with index
 * 0 in the returned binary tree only maps binary nodes 0 <= ... < tree.size() -1.
 * Due to the last element of tree being the maximum Morton code 2^(30 or 61),
 * the last node/element of the returned binary tree will be set up as a useless
 * second root node that is not reachable from the root node with index 0.
 * So if \a tree is a cornerstone octree with an array size of N, we can say that
 *      - \a tree has N-1 octree leaf nodes
 *      - the output is a binary tree of array size N-1 with 0...N-2 as usable elements
 *
 * One could of course prevent the generation of the last binary node with index N-1,
 * but that would result in loss of generality for arbitrary sorted Morton code sequences
 * without duplicates.
 *
 * A GPU version of this function can launch a thread for each node [0:nNodes] in parallel.
