 * \author Sebastian Keller <sebastian.f.keller@gmail.com>
 *
 * General algorithm:
 *      cornerstone octree (leaves) -> internal binary radix tree -> internal octree
 *
 * Like the cornerstone octree, the internal octree is stored in a linear memory layout
 * with tree nodes placed next to each other in a single buffer. Construction
 * is fully parallel and non-recursive and non-iterative. Traversal is possible non-recursively
 * in an iterative fashion with a local stack.
