 * @param[in]  excludeRange   range defined by two SFC codes to exclude from collision search
 *                            any leaf nodes fully contained in the specified range will not be
 *                            reported as collisions
 *
 * At all traversal steps through the hierarchy of the internal binary radix tree,
 * all 3 x,y,z dimensions are checked to determine overlap with a binary node.
 * If the Morton codes used to construct the binary tree satisfy the requirements of
 * a cornerstone octree, it would be sufficient to only check
 *
 * x at nodes with prefixLength % 3 == 1
 * y at nodes with prefixLength % 3 == 2
 * z at nodes with prefixLength % 3 == 0
 *
 * because the cornerstone invariants guarantee that each internal binary node will
 * have one more bit in its prefix than its parent.
 *
 * However, the construction of the internal tree and the following traversal as
 * implemented also works if an arbitrary sorted sequence of Morton codes was used
 * for the construction of the internal tree, i.e. holes or omission of empty nodes
 * would be possible. Since this capability might be useful in the future, and the
 * cost to check all 3 dimensions at each step should not be very high, we keep
 * the implementation general.
